Simple sleeve to protect a Raspberry Pi* from falling screws.  The main part of the case slides over the Raspberry Pi, and a cap fits around the connectors. 

Updated March 2018: Added a new version (2.0) with a larger cutout for the microSD card since newer models aren't spring loaded.  I also loosened up the tolerances and tweaked the design to make it easier to print, and added a latch to the cap so the Raspberry Pi is less likely to fall out.

Simple sleeve to protect a Raspberry Pi* from falling screws.  The main part of the case slides over the Raspberry Pi, and a cap fits around the connectors.  The parts are only held in place by friction so it probably isn't a good option for transport or if you frequently plug / unplug devices (mine just sits under my printer running Octoprint).  Only the ports along the sides are exposed.  

The cap part may need a small amount scaling on the z axis since the height can vary significantly with layer height and first layer thickness.  

Filament:
-- Colorfabb Red PLA/PHA*
